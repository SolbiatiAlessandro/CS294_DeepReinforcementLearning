Starting [CS294-112 Berkley - Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)

The repo containes notes for the courses, and in the future homeworks. Starting from lecture 04 we want to publish medium articles with our solution to homeworks. 
The `lectures` folder contains notes whereas the `homework` folder contains code. If wonder where this weird format for the code in `homeworks` come from you might want to check my other project [relna (Reinforcement Learning Arena)](https://github.com/solbiatialessandro/relna)
