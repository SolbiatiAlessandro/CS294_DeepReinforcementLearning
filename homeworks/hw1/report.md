## Behavioural cloning

TODO:
1. generate rollouts
This are sequences of the type expertSequence#1 = {s0 -> a0, s1 -> a1, s2 -> a3} done with the expert policy

expert_data/something.pkl
big number -> 18101
observations.shape = (big number, 44)
actions.shape = (big number, 17)
returns.shape = (20, )

2. implement behavioural cloning
implement a neural net of the sort F(s) = a trained on all the expertSequence. Then create a policy using the neural net
