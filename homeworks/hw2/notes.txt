(alex) why does tf.layers.dense has a kernel? isn't kernel only for convolutions layers?

help(tf.layers.dense):
dense(inputs, units, activation=None, use_bias=True, kernel_initializer=None, bias_initializer=<tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops.Zeros object at 0x129afa240>, kernel_regularizer=None, bias_regularizer=None, activity_regularizer=None, kernel_constraint=None, bias_constraint=None, trainable=True, name=None, reuse=None)
    Functional interface for the densely-connected layer.

    This layer implements the operation:
    `outputs = activation(inputs.kernel + bias)`
    Where `activation` is the activation function passed as the `activation`
    argument (if not `None`), `kernel` is a weights matrix created by the layer,
    and `bias` is a bias vector created by the layer
    (only if `use_bias` is `True`).

    Arguments:
      inputs: Tensor input.
      units: Integer or Long, dimensionality of the output space.
      activation: Activation function (callable). Set it to None to maintain a
        linear activation.
      use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias.
      kernel_initializer: Initializer function for the weight matrix.
        If `None` (default), weights are initialized using the default
        initializer used by `tf.get_variable`.
      bias_initializer: Initializer function for the bias.
      kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function for the weight matrix.
      bias_regularizer: Regularizer function for the bias.
      activity_regularizer: Regularizer function for the output.
      kernel_constraint: An optional projection function to be applied to the
          kernel after being updated by an `Optimizer` (e.g. used to implement
          norm constraints or value constraints for layer weights). The function
          must take as input the unprojected variable and must return the
          projected variable (which must have the same shape). Constraints are
          not safe to use when doing asynchronous distributed training.
      bias_constraint: An optional projection function to be applied to the
          bias after being updated by an `Optimizer`.
      trainable: Boolean, if `True` also add variables to the graph collection
        `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` (see `tf.Variable`).
      name: String, the name of the layer.
      reuse: Boolean, whether to reuse the weights of a previous layer
        by the same name.

    Returns:
      Output tensor the same shape as `inputs` except the last dimension is of
